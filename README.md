## 📝 Description

This project demonstrates a creative DOM manipulation exercise featuring a glass swapping animation effect. Created as part of the Front-End learning module in the FGO24 (Full-stack Generasi GIGIH Online 2024) bootcamp, it showcases interactive element switching with smooth transitions.

## ✨ Features

- Dynamic glass swapping animation triggered by user interaction
- Smooth transition effects between different glass states
- Implementation using vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Responsive design that works across various screen sizes
- Clean, modern UI with appealing visual aesthetics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)
- Live-server for development environment

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (to run live-server)
- Text editor (recommended: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## 🚀 How to Use

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riezaekatomara/fgo24-dom-switch-glassswapping.git
cd fgo24-dom-switch-glassswapping
```

### Running the Project

1. Install live-server if you don't have it already:

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

2. Run live-server in the project directory:

```bash
live-server
```

3. A browser will automatically open with the application running at `http://localhost:8080`

4. Click on the switch button to trigger the glass swapping animation!

## 📱 Interactive Display

The project features an interactive display where clicking on a switch element causes glasses to swap positions with smooth animations. Try clicking multiple times to enjoy the fluid transitions!
